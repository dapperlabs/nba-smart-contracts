    Description: Central Collection for a large number of topshot
                 NFTs

    This resource object looks and acts exactly like a TopShot MomentCollection
    and (in a sense) shouldnâ€™t have to exist! 
    The problem is that Cadence currently has a limitation where 
    storing more than ~100k objects in a single dictionary or array can fail. 
    Most MomentCollections are likely to be much, much smaller than this, 
    and that limitation will be removed in a future iteration of Cadence, 
    so most people will never need to worry about it.

    However! The main TopShot administration account DOES need to worry about it
    because it frequently needs to mint >10k Moments for sale, 
    and could easily end up needing to hold more than 100k Moments at one time.
    
    Until Cadence gets an update, that leaves in a bit of a pickle!

    This contract bundles together a bunch of MomentCollection objects 
    in a dictionary, and then distributes the individual Moments between them 
    while implementing the same public interface 
    as the default MomentCollection implementation. 
    If we assume that Moment IDs are uniformly distributed, 
    a ShardedCollection with 10 inner Collections should be able 
    to store 10x as many Moments (or ~1M).

    When Cadence is updated to allow larger dictionaries, 
    then this contract can be retired.

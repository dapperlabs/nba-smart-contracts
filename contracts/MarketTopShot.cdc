    Description: Contract definitions for users to sell their moments

    Marketplace is where users can create a sale collectio that they
    store in their account storage. In the sale collection, 
    they can put their NFTs up for sale with a price and publish a 
    reference so that others can see the sale.

    If another user sees an NFT that they want to buy,
    they can send fungible tokens that equal or exceed the buy price
    to buy the NFT.  The NFT is transferred to them when
    they make the purchase.

    each user who wants to sell tokens will have a sale collection 
    instance in their account that holds the tokens that they are putting up for sale

    They can give a reference to this collection to the central contract
    that it can list the sales in a central place
